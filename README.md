This is the thesis project of Orfeas Kalipolitis.

The project is written as a maven netbeans wep app with tomcat as the preferred
server and uses java servlets for back-end communication.

In order to prepare your server to run everything included, please:

1. Make sure python3 is installed on the server and is aliased as python
2. Use pip3 (install if not present) to install python dependencies like so: 
   pip3 install beautifulsoup4 bs4 nltk urllib3
3. In the project folder, run:
   python3 src/webCrawler/nltkDataDownload.py
   (this will install the necessary nltk packages we need)
4. Edit the file: src/main/resources/serverProperties.properties so path2experiments reflects the absolute path to your preferred experiments folder.
5. Open the project in Netbeans and run it from there or compile it with maven and run it on your preferred Java Servlet Container software (tested on Netbeans using Apache Tomcat 8).

Precautions
I have taken every precaution to not be spotted by Google as a bot, that for me entailed using a VPN service as to hide my IP. With the current configuration I have not had any problems, but I still recommend using some VPN service just in case.
