This is the thesis project of Orfeas Kalipolitis.

The project is written as a maven netbeans wep app with tomcat as the preferred
server and uses java servlets for back-end communication.

In order to prepare your server to run everything included, please:

Install python3 if you don't have it.
Install pip3 if you don't have it.

Make python reference python3 if that's not the case on the server
which this project is run on.

run: pip3 install beautifulsoup4 bs4 nltk urllib3
and: python3 src/webCrawler/nltkDataDownload.py
to satisfy all of the crawler's requirements.

Before attempting to compile/run the project, please also edit the file:
src/main/resources/serverProperties.properties
so path2experiments reflects the absolute path to your preferred experiments folder.
